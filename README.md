After enabling plugin there will be two additional menu entries in *Project/Tools*.

*Icon Creator* is used to make icon from single file (all icon versions will be upscaled or downscaled) or six files in resolutions of 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256.

*Icon Replacer* changes icon in exported Windows executable. Remember to use icon file created by *Icon Creator* because such icon is uncompressed and has exact required size.
